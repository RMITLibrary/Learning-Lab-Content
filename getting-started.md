# Getting started

## About the instituion

Tertiary institutions are large places with lots of different spaces and people who support it. Like any community, everyone has as role and makes a contribution to keep things running. We might only view these training organisations as places to learn, though they do so much more to contribute to society, so having an understanding will help you get the most out your time there. 

This section will introduce you to the people and places that make up a tertiary institution and help unpack some of the concepts so it feels a little more familiar.

### Spaces and resources

#### The Campus

University campuses are vibrant spaces and can be crowded with people walking to various buildings and social spaces. The makeup of the campus community is normally students, teaching, professional staff and visitors.

Some of your learning may take place on campus and the spaces are set up for a variety of different types of learning; including spaces such as:
* Lecture Theatre
* Labs
* Classrooms for Tutorials 
* Media Studios
* Creative spaces
* Study spaces
* The Library
* Common areas
* Cafes

Wifi allows you to connect your pc, laptop, mobile phone or tablet device without using a cable connectivity. Wifi access points are across the campus everywhere, so everywhere is study space.

University campuses provide recreational and social spaces for students such as sports facilities, like gyms, basketball courts, running tracks. Social events are held on campus for students to socialise and get to know their peers.

##### University Library as community and cultural space

University libraries are collaborative and centrally located spaces in which the university community can come together to build a sense of place and feeling of community. A community can be a virtual or a physical (or both) space where people sharing common interests, goals or/and experiences. come together to share, connect, exchange and work towards shared goals. Libraries are spaces in which students can receive support to solve their questions and problems, enhancing their study experience.
 
Universities commonly have artistic and creative spaces such as art galleries, cinemas, dance spaces and makerspaces. 


##### Why Study Space is Important

When commencing tertiary education there will times you will need to use designated study spaces on campus or at home for group work, individual study and listening to online lectures and presentations.

The space in which you work plays an important role in your productivity as well as improving focus and efficiency. 

When setting up a study space it’s a good idea to have all the materials you need within reach. That could be physical items like a notebook, pens, highlighters. Course material like course notes, textbooks, calculator.

When setting up a digital study space to organise your resources consider   bookmarking all the study resources you use frequently. Also, set up some folders for online documents for your courses. Check out more about technology to help with your studies at this following link: …...

When working in a group space on campus, or at home, you will need is a space in which you and your group members can talk freely and exchange ideas and plan your work. Booking a group room on campus is one option and another is to arrange an online meeting with your group.

When setting up an individual home study space, choose a space which allows you to control the lighting, sound, and temperature. Creating a comfortable environment with fewer distractions is more conducive to concentration. One of the advantages of working from home is you set up your study environment as you wish.

Important to a good study space are: 
* a dedicated desk, 
* comfortable ergonomic chair, 
* access to power, 
* access to internet
* good lighting
* temperature – not too hot or cool

### Educator types

Educators are academics and or professionals who help students gain and practice knowledge. You will meet variety of educators throughout your learning process at tertiary educational institutes. The types of educators that you encounter can vary depending on your level of study, I.e., VE, HE or postgraduate. Even within the same level of study, you might not interact with all listed here.

#### Academic
An Academic is a general term that could refer to a number of types of educators at a university. Some academics don’t do any teaching, focussing on research only, while some do both teaching and research. An academic might be your tutor, lecturer or a professor or dean running an entire school within your college. 

#### Program coordinators/program managers

Program coordinators are responsible for the overall quality of a degree program or certificate program. If you have any questions about the courses you have selected for a particular year or want to swap courses or drop a course, the program coordinator would be your first point of contact to get advice. 

Main responsibilities of a program coordinator include: 
* Develop short and long-term goals for the program
* Scheduling courses, teaching teams and timetabling of the program
* Work closely with course coordinators to organise off-campus programs such as internships, placements, study tours etc.
* Manage program resources such as budgets, facilities, types of equipment.
 
#### Course coordinator

Course coordinators are responsible for designing, planning and delivering a particular course within a degree/certificate program. They are your first point of contact if you have any queries about the course such as learning materials, timetables, assessment dates, late submission for assessments etc.

Some of the responsibilities of a course coordinator are:
* Work closely with the program manager and the department head to prepare course objectives
* Lead the development of the learning materials, assessments and canvas site of the particular course
* Lead the course teaching team
* Organise textbooks and other resources for the course
* Recruitment, training and management of the tutors for the particular course
* Organise guest lectures or industry expert seminars

#### Lecturer/VE Teacher

The primary role of the lecturer is to facilitate the learning process and assess and mentor students according to the course curriculum. Lectures are content experts in a specific discipline. Often your course coordinator and/or program coordinator can also be one of the lecturers delivering the course. For VE educators, the primary term used is the teacher. The delivery environment of the learning material can be a classroom/lecture theatre (face-to-face) or online (via Teams or Collaborate Ultra). When you have difficulties understanding course materials, you can always contact your lecturer and ask for further explanation.
Main responsibilities of a lecturer/VE teacher include:
* The delivery of quality education and training to the students. 
* Engage students in the learning process.
* Training for technical skills associated with the course, such as laboratory skills, computer skills etc.
* Assessment preparation and marking.

#### Guest lecturers and Industry Professionals

Most university level courses offer lectures/seminars from guest lecturers or industry professionals as work-integrated learning. Guest lecturers and industry professionals are experts in their fields. They share insights and experiences from their career as well as current knowledge in the industry or profession. An opportunity to learn from an expert in your profession is a highly valuable experience. These seminars provide an opportunity to ask questions about the industry/profession you will enter after your studies, as well as a networking platform. 
 
#### Tutors

Tutors are a vital part of a course-teaching team. They usually deliver tutorial sessions, workshops and lectorials with or without a lecturer. Tutors help you understand the tutorial questions, help you with complex concepts from the course material and provide feedback on your learning. If you are hesitant to ask questions from a lecturer, tutors will be your next option. Most importantly, they are more approachable during the class/session. Most tutors in undergraduate and postgraduate courses are current PhD students. They are friendly, welcoming you with questions and supportive, as well as experts in the subject content.

#### Librarians

A Librarian is an information professional who supports learning, teaching and research. They offer training and support to connect the university community with the information and resources they need. They’re available to support the university though various channels, including workshops, consultations and through online chat. Librarians are experts in information literacy, which is the ability to identify and evaluate reliable sources of information. 

#### Academic Skills Advisors 

Experts in a range of areas, Skills Advisors work to support students to succeed in their studies. This could include writing, language and assessment. Some are specialists in subject areas including science, maths and English. They make themselves available through a variety of ways, including workshops, one-on-one consultations online/face to face and embedded in classes. If you need help with your course work, it could be to check your writing or solve a mathematical equation or to further explain a science concept, academic skills advisors are there to help you. 

#### Laboratory Demonstrators /Technicians

Laboratory demonstrators play a vital role in the delivery of practical-based classes. They possess sound knowledge of the theory as well as laboratory skills and techniques. Laboratory demonstrators teach and assist you with laboratory skills. They are approachable for student queries during the session, provide clear explanations combing theory and the practical aspect and provide feedback on your laboratory skills and laboratory-based written work. In VE, laboratory demonstrators are termed, technicians.
 
#### Placement supervisors

A placement supervisor is a professional of a particular field allocated by the respective organisation to guide, mentor and support student’s learning process during their placement period. They are usually willing to share knowledge, provide close guidance to develop professional practice skills and create a supportive environment to work. 

#### HDR Supervisors

Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students have completed a undergraduate degree and are continuing their studies through completing a postgraduate study. This may include a Masters’ by research or PhD (Doctor of Philosophy).

The Higher Degree by Research (HDR) supervisory team guide, mentor, and support their students throughout the HDR candidature. The HDR supervisory team comprises a primary supervisor, co-supervisors and associate supervisors. The primary supervisor leads the supervisory team and is mainly responsible for the student’s candidature. Also, responsible for the student's ongoing progress, arranging milestone panels, preparing the student for the milestone review, and ensuring the student has access to the required resources and the facilities to complete the study. Associate supervisors provide support with a particular area of the research. The primary supervisor is the main point of contact for students for any query.

### Blended Learning

Many universities have transitioned to blended learning since the beginning of the Covid 19 pandemic. The blended learning experience is a mix of online and face to face activities. Blended learning is flexible, accessible, inclusive and connected, supported by specialist spaces, services and technologies. The university isn’t just a physical place, and much of your learning and connections will be undertaken online. A mixture of in-person and online learning is referred to as ‘Blended Learning’.

Digital learning is a core part of every student’s experience. This may be in the form of readings, videos or other kinds of learning materials that you can access through digital learning platforms as you learn at your own pace. Blended learning programmes may include a rich mixture of face-to-face and/or online learning activities use of different media including text, audio or visual media opportunities to explore different learning methods and/or activities.

A typical example of a blended learning timetable usually means that your lecturers will create in-person classes in the physical classroom and combine them with online classes. A typical blended learning schedule would be something like:

Monday: In person class
Tuesday: In-person Class
Wednesday: Online Class & Activities 
Thursday: In-person Class
Friday: Live Online Class & Activities

### The Flipped Classroom

The 'flipped classroom' is the term commonly defined as a pedagogical model in which traditional lecture and homework elements are reversed. In a flipped classroom, students explore the material outside the classroom and then spend time with the tutor clarifying and developing deeper knowledge through discussion and activities (Allan, 116).

### Concurrent Teaching

Concurrent teaching is when a class is both face-to-face and online at the same time. Students who need to attend university remotely can tune into a lecture via live video stream on their own device. 
Supplementary / Other ways to learn / Learning
As well as the material and assessment offered by your teachers, there’s plenty of other ways to get the most out of your time while you study. You may be eligible to undertake short courses, or other types of training that have no additional cost. These might help you develop skills which are valuable to employers in a workplace and give you an advantage over other graduates. 

## University structure

A university is generally led by the Vice-Chancellor and governed by the council and the academic board. Each university has their own values, policies, and legislation developed according to the national standards, which they obey and respect. Universities are comprised of academic bodies and operational and strategic bodies. Academic bodies deliver the university’s major teaching, learning and research services. Tertiary institutions have different names for academic bodies, which may include college, faculty, portfolio. These academic bodies are named and categorised based on the study program that they offer. A college or faculty generally comprises several schools or departments. All courses and programs are coordinated by the school, which is part of the college/faculty. Students may not need to know which college or school they’re part of, though it may help when they’re engaging with university services.

Tertiary institutions facilitate teaching, learning, research, and community engagement across a wide range of disciplines. Teaching and learning are conducted via different levels of study programs offered to students via national and international university campuses and in some cases from a fully online service.

### Teaching and learning


Tertiary institutions offer a wide range of study programs ranging from vocational education and higher education to postgraduate education in many disciplines.

#### Pre-university study

Some tertiary institutions provide pre-university study programs for domestic and international students to prepare them for tertiary studies or students who required extra support to get into a university-level program or who are keen to brush up their skills before starting at the university level. These programs may include:

#### Vocational study

Many Australian universities offer a wide variety of vocational education or TAFE (technical and further education) programs, such as certificate programs, diplomas and advanced diplomas. Most of these programs help you to get into the degree of your interest such as associate degrees and bachelor’s degrees. 

#### Undergraduate study

Associate degrees, bachelor’s degrees and honours degrees offered by tertiary education institutes are considered undergraduate degrees. Most Australian universities offer undergraduate degree programs in STEM, business, law, education, social science, etc. Check out the webpage of your choice of university for university specific admission details.  

#### Associate degrees 

Associate degrees are two-year programs comprised of both theory and practical knowledge, however, providing substantial components of work-integrated learning. This is a stand-alone qualification to enter the workforce as well as a pathway to enter a relevant bachelor’s degree. Universities offer associate degrees in many areas of study, including applied science, engineering science, graphic design, professional writing and editing, health sciences, screen and media production etc. 
 
#### Bachelor’s degrees

Bachelor’s degrees are usually three-year programs comprising theory and practical aspects of the respective study discipline. However, some professional degrees can take up to 4 to 5 years, depending on the study discipline.  These degrees are open to both domestic and international students. 
 
#### Honours degree

The honours degree is a one-year specialised study that is generally undertaken upon the completion of the bachelor’s degree. Typically, students are required to have a high GPA from a bachelor’s to enter an honours degree. With an honours degree, you specialised in a specific area of your discipline. This degree is comprised of a larger portion of research or placement and coursework components. Honours degrees generally prepare you for masters by research or doctoral degree. You can undertake an honours degree in a different university than your bachelor’s degree. However, entry requirements can be different in different universities.

#### Postgraduate studies by coursework

A postgraduate program is generally any study that you undertake upon completion of your bachelor’s degree. Occasionally with extensive industry experience, you might be eligible to undertake a postgraduate program without a bachelor’s degree. Many tertiary education institutes offer different levels of postgraduate programs: graduate certificates, graduate diplomas and masters. In some cases, graduate certificates and diplomas can provide a pathway to enter a masters degree. 

#### Research degrees
Research degrees are master and doctoral degrees across many disciplines. These programs are comprehensive research conducted independently under the guidance of an expert academic, which refers to a supervisor. You can conduct research as a thesis model or project model, depending on the discipline of study. Masters by research degrees are two years of full-time work, and PhDs are four years of full-time work.  

#### Online Course

Some universities offer fully online short courses, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in many study areas. The core study areas include artificial intelligence, design, marketing, business and finance, health, science and engineering, data analytics and information technology.
 
#### Other types of learning and recognition : Recognised Prior Learning/Credit

Recognised Prior Learning (also known as Credit) is the recognition of previous study or learning that can be counted towards a current program. 

This can reduce the number of units (courses) needed to complete your program, which means the length and cost of your studies are reduced and you don’t need to spend time learning things you already know. 

You can use a variety of documentation to apply for RPL such as records of completed training, letter from an employer.
