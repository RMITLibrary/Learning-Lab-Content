# Getting started

## What will I do?

The transition from high school or work to higher education is a big step in your life journey. Many of you who come from school can feel unprepared for studying in higher education. Others back to study from work can find it challenging to get yourself updated with all study expectations. 

Many of you also move from overseas to Australia to study and can feel overwhelmed with study and cultural adaptations. It is normal for everyone to have those feelings when transitioning to higher education. Here are some tips that you can do to have a head start in your transition.

Starting tertiary education is as an exciting opportunity to further your academic aspirations and invest in your career, while also learning and growing as an individual.

### Orientation program 

Tertiary institutions aim to ensure you get the most out of your time in your study, and we appreciate that the first few months will be a time of change for you. You’re expected to navigate a new campus, meet new people and develop a new way of learning. While you will work out many of these changes yourself, there is a wide range of support to help you transition to this new way of learning. 

Your institution will run an orientation program to help you get started. This will include events, activities and resources. Often this commences before classes are timetabled to start, so you have the time to explore the campus and develop new habits. 
The people who will help you through your studies will be your teachers, professional and academic support services, and your fellow students. 
This period is perfect to get to know them better. Once classes start, so does the coursework.

Your university email will offer most of the communications to help you get the most out of the orientation program. There will be events and activities run by clubs and societies and offers from partner organisations. Some of these will be promoted on campus, so travelling onto campus if you can during this time may help you get the most out of the Orientation Program.


If you enrol late or miss the orientation program, you might have to work a little harder to get an understanding of adapting to tertiary life. Keep an eye around if you need support as all the support and information is available all year around.

### Changing habits / self-direction

One of the biggest challenges to learning at a tertiary level is having to develop successful habits and adopting new ways of learning and working. While secondary school does some of the work to prepare you for the world of work and study, higher education expects more of you.

#### Habits, good and bad

A habit is a tendency of your behaviour that repeats until it starts to happen automatically. Some good habits take some time to form and might be difficult at first. Simple things like brushing your teeth daily start as a difficult change to our lives, until we do them daily without thinking. 

Many of the habits you develop as part of tertiary study will work the same way to form, but they will support you through the rest of your life, so it’s never too early to explore ways of working that suit you. You will have a range of class and assessment types, and teaching styles may also vary. It’s worth keeping an open mind that one way of studying may not suit all the activities.

#### Self-direction, doing it yourself

A key factor in being a success in your studies will be your ability to be self directed. You may not have immediate access to teachers to answer questions, and there may be a shortage of support services when you need them most. Assessment periods at your institution may mean everyone needs help at the same time. Organising your time, developing good habits early and having a ‘Plan B’ for some of the challenges presented will ensure you’re ready for anything.

#### Pulling it all together with a portfolio

A portfolio is a record of your academic accomplishments and progress, as well as any professional development and reflections on your work. A portfolio is a collection of documents that best represent your achievements.

Your studies are intended to change you in ways that they help you develop the skills and potential to be a success. This progress can be demonstrated by a compilation of your best works and related material and activities throughout your studies.  This provides evidence of your progression and success.

Developing a portfolio like this can help you maintain confidence and may help evidence your learning and capability post-study. After graduation, you may want to use it for seeking further study or employment. A portfolio is also a great way to present your capabilities for the next step in your career. With all the varied types of activities you undertake as part of your study, there’s a lot you can capture to tell the story of your skill development and ability.

### Socialisation

A new place often equals meeting new people. In higher education, those new relationships can have even more meaning. Take time at the start of your studies:

Get to know your teachers and their expectations
This can help you to learn more effectively in classes as you will know how to study and interact with them as you will develop an understanding of their expectations. 

Educators can also help you to figure out what career pathway you might want to take and how to get desired internships and jobs. Your teachers have industry experience and networks that may help you connect with your chosen field.

#### Get to know your peers

It is beneficial for you to get connected (online and on-campus) with other students in your course. You can find them in the orientation events and in class. 

Reach out to say hello and introduce yourself to others. You will likely share similar study interests and expectations that deserve an exchange of ideas and a chance of networking.

#### Join groups, activities or cultural clubs

There are a many ways to become involved in social life at tertiary study. Group activities that are on campus or within the wider community can help you establish friendships and support networks. Your participation can provide you with valuable experience and skills in collaborating, negotiating and reducing conflicts with others. 

Besides, this will set you up with good people skills later in your studies when working with other students. Group participation can also help build essential collaborative skills for the workplace and in life. 

### New ways to learn / Academic Adjustments 

#### Learn independently

You are expected to learn independently at tertiary study. You take charge of your learning experience by motivating yourself.

This will help keep you on top of your study and time management skill will be key in being a success in your learning. Take an independent approach in managing class timetables, attending classes, reading course materials before class.

#### Learn actively

Active learning is another core skill in tertiary study. In active learning, you take active control of your study by choosing the suitable learning strategies that make your study deeply meaningful for you. The active learning strategies vary but can include: 
-	Understanding, assessing and questioning information
-	Finding tricks and tips to help you get more organised
-	Reading additional resources beyond required readings
-	Developing a habit of reading, understanding, writing, synthesising materials.

#### Think critically

You will use critical thinking in higher education to read, assess, question, challenge and consider the pros and cons of the information in your study. This skill can be developed once you have considered different viewpoints of an issue. 
 Critical thinking is one of the important skills to stand out from the crowds in your class and in the workplace.
You can take the Critical Thinking module on RMIT Learning Lab to practise your knowledge about this important skill.  [callout]

#### Learn collaboratively

It is essential to learn to work collaboratively with others. Let’s expect that you will study within the constraints of different class groups. You may be in a class of 300 or 25, and you will likely work with some of them in groupwork.  How you work within different class sizes and in groups might impact your approach with your peers. 
Get yourself prepared with collaborative learning with tips in Group Work [link]. These will be useful for completing class discussion activities or group assessments where there will be several students contributing to a assessment.

#### Learn with integrity

Academic integrity
[Definition goes here]
In your tertiary study, you are expected to work with a high level of academic integrity. Academic integrity is defined as when the “wider academic community is built on shared values and norms of behaviour, including honesty, fairness and responsibility” (La Trobe University 2022:para. 1). This integrity requirement applies to you as an active member of the academic community. You can demonstrate your knowledge and abidance by academic integrity rules by attending to and applying several points below into your study:
be honest, fair and respectful in all academic activities, from completing your assignments to sitting exams
employ good academic practice, whether you are working alone or with a group of classmates
ensure your work, both individual and collaborative, acknowledges any information that has influenced your thinking. This includes everything from books and articles, to websites and images
take personal responsibility for ensuring you act appropriately in your studies
understand that these practices are applicable to the whole academic community. This includes students, staff and other professionals.

#### Acknowledge other people’s work by referencing

In tertiary study, you will learn how to acknowledge other people’s ideas in your work by using referencing systems. You will reference the source(s) both in your writing (in-text citation) and at the end of your writing (in bibliography, or reference list). 
Referencing styles can vary from one discipline to another, so it is good to check out with your teachers what referencing style is used in your course (Your referencing style will be one of the styles here). If you have little experience with referencing before, it is good to know that it takes time to master all the gritty-nitty formats of your style – you don’t need be an expert right away. The Library staff are experts in referencing, and can help you.

#### Time Management 

In higher education, it is not uncommon that you need to commit your time to different things besides your study, including work, family and social life. It is good to keep in mind that if you do a full-time study load, it can equal a full-time job. 

So it is important to manage your time in ways that can often prioritise your studies, amongst other things. There are couple of things that you can do to use your time wisely and keep the load moving. These include; 
•	Use time management tools such as Weekly Planner to control, allocate and keep track of your time to different commitments. 
•	Stay focused on your tasks by getting away from distractions such as screens and noise (if you need time to read and write) 
•	Avoid procrastination. You might think that you can work better under the last-minute pressure. The fact is that you can get even more stressful with multiple study and work deadlines at the same time.
It is better to plan and act early.

### Assessment Types

During your tertiary study, you will have different forms of assessments that aim to test your knowledge and skills for each course. Assessment marks and feedback are also a way to keep track of your academic progress and achievements.

Keep in mind that you may have multiple assessments due around the same time, so planning and working on them early, as well as good time management skills are pivotal to positive assessment outcomes. Some of popular assessments in your course might include but are not limited to the following types:

* Essays
* Reports
* Case studies
* Oral Presentations
* Group projects
* Creative development (exegesis, artefacts, artwork, etc.)
* Laboratory work
* Self and Peer-to-peer Assessments
* Online Quizzes
* Exams

.
### Class types

There’s a variety of class types that might be part of your timetable. These are decided by your teachers to be an affective way to learn the material. You may have prepare differently for each type of session.

Some of the following class types in your tertiary study may include:

* Tutorials: Small group activity focused on discussion, including non-specialist lab classes, with a up of 40 students
* Lectorials: Lecture model of delivery with up to 120 students, there may be a participation element of this mode.
* Practicals: Teacher-led practice in laboratory or studio spaces 
* Workshops: Activities are similar to a tutorial but with the addition of a practical component.
* Digital Interactive sites: These digital content or activities might include pre-recorded lecture content, discussion forums, and interactive digital activities such as demonstrations, assessment tasks and submissions.
