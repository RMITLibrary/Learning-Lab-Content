# Getting started

## Who will help me

Your tertiary institution is there for you. There are lots of structures and services run by people who want you to succeed in your studies and be a valuable contributor in your chosen industry when you graduate. 

Some of the people who aim to help you’ll meet in the first week in orientation and some you might have to seek out directly. Knowing who is there and what they can do to support your studies and time at Uni or TAFE is a shared responsibility.

In this module we’ll introduce to some of the people who can help you achieve your goals, find your way and support you if things don’t go as expected.   

### University Administration

WIIFM

#### Enrolment and other admin

All tertiary institutions provide services to help with things like enrolment, fees, timetables, student cards and support services.
Many of these systems are automated, though….

If you need help with your enrolment, unsure how to connect online, or would like to meet other students? There are many people and services available to help you. 

Usually, the home page for your institution will contain links to this information. Or, look for the Students or Current Students section of the institution’s website where you will be able to access the relevant information. 

Your college, school or faculty that manages your course can also be a useful place for you to get help with administrative matters. Contact with these units can often be made online through the Learning Management System (LMS) or by calling or chatting with the course coordinator or administrator. 

#### Information technology support 

Support for information technology products and access is also available where you are studying. Often called IT support or
ITS, they will provide support with things like wifi access, passwords, software, and accessing other university systems. 

#### Student groups

Tertiary initiations have a range of student groups that can support you in your study, connect you with other students, and help you to get involved in a range of activities outside of your coursework.

There will be sporting, cultural and social clubs, as well as academic societies you can join to expand your social network and enrich your university experience. 

Tertiary institutions will also have a student union [link], where you can get information about student groups as well as support or information, including about your rights as a student. 

### Study Support and Library Services 

If you need help with your studies, there will be a variety of ways of accessing that. Online as well as face-to-face options are available that can enhance your learning. Online channels can include library chat or online consultations with an academic skills advisor, and there are often online self-help materials and tutorials across a range of topics and subjects. In real life, workshops, drop-in sessions, and your peers can also help you. 

#### Online Chat

Most libraries at tertiary institutions will have an online chat service that you can use to contact the library and librarians [link]. Use the online chat to ask questions about library services and activities, finding information for your assignments, referencing and support for your studies. 

#### Academic Skills and Research Support

Academic Skills Advisors [link] and Librarians can provide additional study support. Academic Skills Advisors can help you with your academic skills, including writing your assignments, referencing, maths, physics, chemistry, statistics and more. 
Librarians can provide more in-depth help with research for your assessment, including how to identify and evaluate the best resources available. 

Online and in person help is available.

#### Course specific - help

Academic Skills Advisors and Librarians are available to help with specific content in courses and will work with your teacher to identify areas where they can provide support. This help can include workshops based on assessment tasks and course content, or targeted instruction that is embedded in classes and can be for individuals or groups of students. 

#### Peer mentoring

Many universities provide a service where students assist their fellow students. These students have achieved high marks in your course and are equipped to help you. They offer course specific advice, as well as general study tips. 
Check your institution’s website, or ask your students’ group or teacher. 

Peer support can also be obtained through informal networks, by meeting with friends to discuss your coursework, or with group project team members. Remember to use the platforms available, like discussions boards and social media, to ask questions and contribute to conversations. 

#### Online resources

Check your institution's student and library pages for online resources that can support your study. Some of the commons tools that you will find include referencing tools and academic skills tutorials. Many libraries also host subject guides that can direct you to the best resources in your area of study. 

### Wellbeing, health and safety

Tertiary institutions have many support services for students’ wellbeing, health and safety. Universities and TAFEs, on the whole, want to encourage an inclusive and welcoming environment for all students, and to provide services for students who may need additional support. 

These services assist students from a range of backgrounds and with different needs, like physical and mental health, and social and cultural identities. Some of the support available includes:
* Equitable learning and disability
* Indigenous students
* International students
* Under 18 students
* LGBTIQ+ students

Services are also designed to support your wellbeing and ensure that you have a safe experience at university. Many institutions will have emergency and crisis support, feedback and complains processes, campus security and financial and legal support. 
Security

Universities are big places with lots of spaces, they also have a 
duty of care for people who work and study there. Even though making a safe environment for others is everyone’s responsibility, it’s the Campus security team’s number one priority to ensure you feel safe and protected. They’re often available 24/7 365 and have a phone number if you need them. 

####  Cultural Safety 

‘Everyone deserves to feel safe, respected, valued and treated as an equal in their place of study’
The institution aims to be a safe place for everyone, and works to address inequity in the community it participates in. 
Some students may experience prejudice and discrimination and feel uncomfortable in some situations. It’s up to everyone to support and create a community that is comfortable.

#### Accessibility

Unfortunately, not all spaces are designed for everyone, there are supports and services that aim to overcome inaccessible environments. Universities are inclusive accessible environments where many students will find digital and physical services and resources easy to understand and navigate. These supports may exist in the physical world, as well as staff who can help or online.
