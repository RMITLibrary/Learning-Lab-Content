There are different methods for determining the quality and reliability of a resource. These include the SIFT and CRAAP methods. 

SIFT

•	Stop
•	Investigate the Source
•	Find Better Coverage, and
•	Trace claims, quotes and media to the original context. 

CRAAP

THE CRAAP method is a checklist you can use to evaluate your source. It explains how you can determine its quality and appropriateness. The criteria includes:
•	Currency
•	Relevance
•	Accuracy
•	Authority
•	Purpose



* Digital identity and wellbeing: 
Using social media means that you have a presence online that can be viewed by many people, including prospective employers. The way that you interact, and the information you present online makes an impression. Be careful about how you engage with online networks, ensuring that anything you contribute is not discriminatory, defamatory or embarrassing.

•	Strong passwords
•	Two-factor authentication
